Description:
    I came across an amazing site by Mike called http://i.seemikecode.com/
    It allows employers to pre-screen prospective interviewees by getting
    them to code into a text area while you view them coding in real-time.
    
    I'm developing my skills in JavaScript, Python and DB's. So when I
    came across Mike's site I thought it'd be fun to reproduce it from
    scratch. This is the result. An AJAX front-end, Python + Google App
    engine back-end system.
    
    Features are a little slim at the moment as I'm just trying to get
    the basics working right and catch all the bugs. However, I hope to
    expand the feature set to include the following:
    
    Wish-list:
        * Password protected rooms
        * Email recipients room URLs
        * Custom room deletion time (1day - 30 days)
        * Remove reliance on bit.ly
        * ..more

    Feel free to use, abuse or ignore this code :-)
